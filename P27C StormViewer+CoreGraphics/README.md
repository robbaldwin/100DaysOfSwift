# Project 3 for #100DaysOfSwift

## Storm Viewer with UIActivityViewController

The challenges for this project were:

1. Try adding the image name to the list of items that are shared. The activityItems parameter is an array, so you can add strings and other things freely. Note: Facebook won’t let you share text, but most other share options will.

2. Go back to project 1 and add a bar button item to the main view controller that recommends the app to other people.

3. Go back to project 2 and add a bar button item that shows their score when tapped.
